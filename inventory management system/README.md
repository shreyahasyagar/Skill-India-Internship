# inventory_management_system
An inventory management system where the addition of products is possible along with billing of products and modifications
The system reads from the present inventory (record file which is in json format) and then the addition of the products can be done by the shopkeeper.
The record file is used for billing of products. When the customer buys the products, changes are made to the inventory and the sales history is written to the sales file.
